# 📌 Project Setup Requirements (needed to be installed)

### 🔹 Python 3.12
### 🔹 Docker and docker compose

<br>

# 🚀 Python Project Setup Workflow

## 🏗️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ Set Up Virtual Environment
```
python3 -m venv venv      # Creates the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate     # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
```

<br>

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Run these command to install packages and dependancies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-linters.txt
```

If you installed additional packages to add them to application use this command

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> This way we ensure track of all packages we installed


<br>

### 3️⃣ Set Up Linters and Pre-commit Hooks

This command will make linters run before each commit and help you to refactor code and keep everything clean <br>

```
pre-commit install
```

> [!TIP]
> Run it only once and all needed dependencies will be installed

<br>

This command will help you when you want to run linters, but do not want to create a commit <br>

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

> [!TIP]
> Can be run multiple times to ensure code quality

<br>

### 4️⃣ Create .env file

Example content of file for a successful build and start

```
DATABASE_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=fastapi
POSTGRES_HOST=db

REDIS_PASSWORD=password
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379

MAKE_MIGRATIONS=false
MAKE_MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE=false
MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE_TARGET=63017c98c3da
```

# 🚀 Docker and Docker Compose: Overview & Standard workflow

### 🔹 What is Docker?

> [!NOTE]
> Docker is a platform that helps developers create, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. <br> Containers bundle everything an application needs, ensuring it works the same way across different systems.

### 🔹 Why Use Docker?

✅ Portability: Runs the same way in any environment. <br>
✅ Scalability: Easy to scale applications. <br>
✅ Efficiency: Uses fewer resources than traditional VMs. <br>
✅ Isolation: Prevents conflicts between applications. <br>

### 📦 Simplifying Dependencies with Containers

> [!NOTE]
> Containers package all required dependencies, eliminating the need for local installations.
> For example, instead of manually installing and configuring a database on your local machine,
> you can run it inside a container, ensuring a consistent and hassle-free setup.

### 🔹 What is Docker Compose?

> [!NOTE]
> Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to manage multi-container applications.
> Instead of running separate docker run commands, you can define everything in a docker-compose.yml file
> and start all services with a single command.


### 🔹 Why Use Docker Compose?

✅ Simplifies multi-container setup. <br>
✅ Allows defining environments in a single file. <br>
✅ Supports easy service scaling. <br>
✅ Reduces manual setup effort. <br>

# 📌 Standard Workflow with Docker Compose

## 🏗️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ Install Docker and Docker Compose

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. You can verify their installation with:

    docker --version
    docker compose --version

<br>

### 2️⃣ Build and Start Services Run

The following command to build images (if needed) and start the services:

    docker compose up --build

After application build and start it will be available by this url http://localhost:5001/

<br>

### 3️⃣ Stop Services

When you're done, shut everything down (in the same terminal where everything was started):

    CTRL+C command

Or run this command in a separate terminal window to stop and remove containers:

    docker compose down

# 📌 Alembic: Database Migrations Guide

### 🔹 What is Alembic?

> Alembic is a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
> It helps track schema changes and apply them across different environments.

<br>

## 📌 Standard Alembic Workflow For Local Usage

### 🔹 Automatically Detect And Apply Schema Changes

Configure variables in your ```.env``` file like this

```
MAKE_MIGRATIONS=true
MAKE_MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE=false
MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE_TARGET=63017c98c3da
```

Migrations will be enabled for the project, and on the startup, they will be automatically created and applied to the database

```
docker compose up --build
```

✅ Alembic inspects SQLAlchemy models and generates migration code(script) automatically.

> [!TIP]
> It is obligatory to import our models so alembic will see them <br>
> You can check a guide in ```app/models/__init__.py``` file



> [!IMPORTANT]
> We should keep track of all migration scripts so we will be able to upgrade or downgrade correctly our production database <br>
>
> For instance, during the implementation of a feature, we created five additional migration files as part of local testing. <br>
> However, to deploy the changes to production, it would be better to delete these five latest migration files
> and create a new, single migration that consolidates the changes from all of them.
> This ensures a cleaner, more efficient migration process for production.

<br>

### 🔹 Downgrade Version After Development of Feature

Let's Assume that we created some number of migrations during implementation of feature and ```63017c98c3da``` is the migration from which we started adding changes

Configure variables in your ```.env``` file like this

```
MAKE_MIGRATIONS=false
MAKE_MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE=true
MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE_TARGET=63017c98c3da
```

Run command to start a project

```
docker compose up --build
```

Then delete all new migration files that were created during implementation and change ```.env``` to making migrations again

```
MAKE_MIGRATIONS=true
MAKE_MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE=false
MIGRATION_DOWNGRADE_TARGET=63017c98c3da
```

Run command to start a project

```
docker compose up --build
```

✅ Now you have one migration script that includes all the changes for implemented feature <br>
This way you will have clean history of migrations

<br>

### 🔹 Manual Migrations Generation

To be able to run migrations command change ```POSTGRES_HOST``` in ```.env``` file and start database

```
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
```

We need to do this because we want to access database from outside of the container

To start database separately use following command

```
docker compose up db
```

Commands to migrate and apply database migrations

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your name of migration"
alembic upgrade head
```

# 📌 Useful Alembic commands


### 🔹 Create a New Migration <br>

```
alembic revision -m "add users table"
```

✅ This generates a new migration script in alembic/versions/.

💡 But it does not create a migration code, so we should manually add it in a created template

<br>

### 🔹 Automatically Detect Schema Changes

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "auto detect changes"
```

✅ Alembic inspects SQLAlchemy models and generates migration code automatically.

💡 Ensure models are imported in env.py for autogeneration to work!

<br>

### 🔹 Apply Migrations to the Database

```
alembic upgrade head
```

✅ This applies all pending migrations up to the latest version.

Use ```alembic upgrade <version_id>``` to apply migrations up to a specific point.

<br>

### 🔹 Revert to a Previous State (Downgrade)

```
alembic downgrade -1
```

✅ This rolls back the last migration.

Use ```alembic downgrade <version_id>``` to revert to a specific version.

<br>

## 📌 Managing Migration History

### 🔹 View Current Migration State

```
alembic current
```

✅ Displays the currently applied migration version.

<br>

### 🔹 Check History of Migrations

```
alembic history
```

✅ Lists all past migrations in order.

<br>

### 🔹 Show Pending Migrations

```
alembic heads
```

✅ Displays the latest (unapplied) migration version(s).

<br>

### 🔹 Manually Stamp Database with a Version

```
alembic stamp head
```

✅ Marks the database as up-to-date without applying migrations.

<br>

## 📌 Common Debugging Commands


### 🔹 Verify Your Migration Script

```
alembic check
```

✅ Checks for issues in migration scripts before applying them.

<br>

### 🔹 Generate SQL Instead of Applying Migration

```
alembic upgrade head --sql
```

✅ Shows SQL statements without running them, useful for debugging.

<br>

## 📌 Cleaning Up and Resetting Migrations


### 🔹 Delete All Migrations and Reset

```
rm -rf alembic/versions/*
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "reset migrations"
alembic upgrade head
```

✅ Deletes old migrations and creates a fresh one based on the current models.
